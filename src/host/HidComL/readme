How to compile:
gcc HidCom.cpp -o HidCom

Usage:
./HidCom -v 03eb -p 204f -s 5 <red> <green> <blue> <mode> <n>
	* 03eb and 204f are the vendor and product id of your Moodlight
	* <mode> sets what your Moodlight should do with the colour
		* 00 glows constantly for <n> seconds
		* 01 blinks <n> times
		* 02 fades <n> times
		* ff is demo mode: it fades through 6 different colours (red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta) <n> times 
	* <n> is the "duration (in seconds/number of turns)"
	* "-s 5" is required to set the "report size" - which appeares to be to long by default

Examples:
	Blink red for 1 second
	./HidCom -v 03eb -p 204f -s  6 ff 00 00 00 01
	
	Fade in green three times
	./HidCom -v 03eb -p 204f -s 5 00 ff 00 02 03

	Run through the demo program twice
	(note that the colour you give HidCom doesn't matter here)
	./HidCom -v 03eb -p 204f -s 5 00 00 00 ff 02

* Depending on your system, you may require root privilege to run HidCom.
